#### Project status - Complete


## Introduction

A fun [web application](https://hollaifyahearme.herokuapp.com/) that creates hot takes regarding the relative coolness of various musicians and bands. Built using the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) framework in Python, and with HTML and CSS for the site itself.

A [friend of mine](https://steveothecripplingaddictions.bandcamp.com/) has been making facebook posts for the last month or so, where he makes a controversial statement of the format:

"*Artist generally considered not to be that cool* is cooler than *artist generally considered to be pretty cool*. Holla if ya hear me."

I had varying reactions to these posts depending on their content, but in general I found them enjoyable. I decided to build a web application which would automate this kind of post.
